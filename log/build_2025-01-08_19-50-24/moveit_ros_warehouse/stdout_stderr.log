[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findwarehouse_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "warehouse_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "warehouse_ros"
  with any of the following names:

    warehouse_rosConfig.cmake
    warehouse_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "warehouse_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "warehouse_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "warehouse_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
