  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "warehouse_ros"

    warehouse_rosConfig.cmake
    warehouse_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "warehouse_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "warehouse_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "warehouse_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
