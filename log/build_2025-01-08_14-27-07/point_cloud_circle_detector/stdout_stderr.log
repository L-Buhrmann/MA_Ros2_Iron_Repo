[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfeatures.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "features",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "features" with any
  of the following names:

    featuresConfig.cmake
    features-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "features" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "features_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "features" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
