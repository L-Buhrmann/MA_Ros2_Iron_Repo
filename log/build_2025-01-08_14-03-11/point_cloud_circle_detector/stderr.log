  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_features" with

  Add the installation prefix of "pcl_features" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pcl_features_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pcl_features" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
